      <h2>I LOVE JOHN LENNON SO MUCH</h2>
      <h3>he is actually the best songwriter ever.<br>
    every single lyric he penned, every melody he hummed, carries this rare, unshakable magic.<br>
    he didn’t just write songs, he built entire worlds with words, melodies, and emotions.<br>
    he was so cool, effortlessly cool, not in a manufactured way, but in the purest sense of being himself.<br>
    he walked through the chaos of fame, the explosion of the beatles phenomenon, and somehow remained singular, true to his vision, his heart, and his conscience.<br>
    and yes, it’s <b>JOHN. FUCKING. LENNON.</b><br>
    the man who dared to imagine a world beyond walls, beyond hatred, beyond the ordinary.<br>
    he wasn’t just a musician, he was a revolutionary, a poet, a dreamer who turned dreams into soundwaves that shook the planet.<br>
    his words were simple yet profound, lines that could make you smile, weep, or think about life in ways you hadn’t before.<br>
    every song he wrote wasn’t just a song, it was a manifesto, a confession, a love letter, a dream.<br>
    even decades later, every note, every word still resonates, reminding us what it means to be alive.<br>
    he was and always will be <b>UNTOUCHABLY, UNARGUABLY, THE BEST.</b></h3>
