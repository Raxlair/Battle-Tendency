                Damn, this show is some of the worst shit I have ever seen, even though
                I have only seen the first two seasons and the Mugen Train movie. To be
                fair the animation is splendid but I hate everything else about it To
                start off, I hate all characters over than Rengoku. Especially Zenitsu.
                He is the most annoying, dumb and creepy character I have ever seen. But
                only slightly better than this we have the MC Tanjiro, who wants to save
                the Demons even though they killed all of his family. If I were Tanjiro
                I would try to kill all the Demons, which shows how unrealistic the show
                is. <br />
