                            Great Show! Kaguya-sama: Love is war has very likable characters aswell
                            as premise. It is unlike anyromance anime I have seen before or since.
                            For anyone who hasn't seen it, it is about two characters, who love each
                            other but don't want to confess as confessing is seen as loosing, so
                            neither of them want to confess. With the episodic structure of the
                            anime, you slowly get to learn about the characters. e.g who they are,
                            what they like and how they act. With a powerfull conclusion. But some
                            people may not like the episodic structure. <br />
